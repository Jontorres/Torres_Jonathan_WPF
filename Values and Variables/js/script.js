//Variables of Different Types, Numbers, Booleans and Strings

//needs to have quotes either single or double
// becarful when using a single quote

//var phrase = 'I don't know'; this would be wrong

//to fix you can do this 
//var phrase = 'I don\'t know';
// or you can do this 
//var phrase = I don\'t know \n You\'ll have to speak with the professor';
/* \n is just making the second half be shown on a new line what is important 
is to use the backslach to show that the ' is not the end of a quote.

// can also use var instead of the numbers

//Expressions
 var a = 2;//sets up our variable a and defiens it as 2
//a + 3; add 3 to A suppose to  but will not because it is not storing it 
//so to make add up to five you have to add this--
var b; //if want to store the value of 5 in B instead of A
b = a + 3;// this stores five into the A variable by usng = which is an assingment operator 
 console.log(b);
 // A's value would now be 2 and B's value is now 5
